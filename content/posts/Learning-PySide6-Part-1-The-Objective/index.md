## Beginning

A week ago I started to lean PySide6, in my previous post I mentioned but hasn't been doing it because of my vacations, but now that I am back home I can resume my learning.

In my work computer/laptop I had no issues installing PySide6 or running scripts but in this computer (my main desktop computer) I had 4 different versions of Python and on top I also installed Conda  (is kind of a manager for installing virtual environments with different versions of Python). So, I was having trouble running PySide6, specially the Hive Block Explorer script that I was talking about last post, it wouldn't run at all. 

I decided to uninstall every version of Python and keep Anaconda because I use it for running Stable Diffusion locally (but that's for another topic). 

## Reinstalling Python Again

I went to the Python official website and downloaded the latest version of Python which was at that time the **3.12.1** version.

Install PySide6 which accordingly with the official website ([Qt for Python - Qt Wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)) can be installed with ` pip install pyside6 ` , I install it that way without a virtual environment.

I proceed to run my Hive Block Explorer script but window does not appear. Up until now I haven't fixed it because I am thinking in redoing all the script to actually get the block info and overall to be a complete Hive alternative to a website frontend.

Examples from the official website or from StackOverflow will run so my installation of PySide6 does work fine.

## Choosing What to Build

I was unsure of what to build because the Hive Block Explorer seems like a bit complex with my current Python Skills, so I came up with a Calculator. 

A Calculator only require only with the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and speaking about the controls, I think buttons and labels will do it, but still not 100% sure if will require to use more type of controls, I will see in the making.

## Wrapping up

I have to finish this post here and continue in another day because it took me too much time to finish this post. I will see you in the next one.
