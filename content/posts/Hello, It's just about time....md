Hello this is my first post here on my newly created site, and every new blog should start with a Hello World post.

I mainly create this site for the sole purpose of personal branding and displaying my future projects and which it will also serve me as a portfolio.

Eventually I will populate this site and do my best to document every piece of information I learned and perhaps, I will apply it in some kind of project or at least, to use it as a reminder.

If you are reading this, and have an opinion or just want to give some beginners advice or what ever you want, you are free to @ me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/csrpazzi) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-pazzi/) because the Disqus does not make a good work notifing you.
