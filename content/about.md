Hi, as you probably know, my name is Cesar and I am an Electronics Engineer graduated from ITR (Reynosa's Technological Institute) from the city of Reynosa in the state of Tamaulipas in Mexico. And I also graduated as a Informatics Technician from high school.

I grew up surrounded by technology (computers, video games and devices), pretty much like kids these days but in the early 90's in a pretty small city (at least in those days), and it was not strange to me when I got my first computer with Windows XP (I've been using Windows since Windows 98) and it was since then I've been tinkering and experimenting with the computer.

Professionally, I proved myself as a valuable asset inside the team because of my skills at leadership, problem solving, analysis and the way I give my best at improving and easing the processes I get to work on.

My knowledge at electronics and computers let me develop solutions for automating repetitive tasks saving up valuable time and resources.

So if you are a recruiter, and all the above does not convince you to hire me, I invite you to check my Projects page or browse my blog posts to get to know me better.
