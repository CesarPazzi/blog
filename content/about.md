Hi, as you probably know, my name is Cesar and I am an Electronics Engineer I also graduated as a Computer Science Technician from high school.

I grew up surrounded by technology (computers, video games and devices), pretty much like kids these days but in the early 90's in a pretty small city (at least in those days).

For me, computers were not a new thing to me when I got my first computer with Windows XP (I've been using Windows since Windows 98) and since then, I've been tinkering and experimenting with the computer and learning what I could.

Professionally, I proved myself as a valuable asset inside the various teams I had the privilege to be part of, because of my skills at leadership, problem solving, analysis and the way I give my best at improving and easing the processes I get to work on.

My knowledge at electronics and computers let me develop solutions for automating repetitive tasks saving up valuable time and resources.

So if you are a recruiter, and all the above does not convince you to hire me, I invite you to check my Projects page or browse my blog posts to get to know me better and I might be the right person to be part of your team.
